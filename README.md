#Screenshare

Screenshare is an application that allows a user to share their current session on a website. This currently works for Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari. For mobile devices, Chrome and Firefox are supported on Android.

[DEMO](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqxTYcNXY-U) video here of it in action



##Requirements

You must have NodeJS > 0.6.x installed, with socket.io and express modules. You can download the latest copy of NodeJS [here](http://nodejs.org).

    npm install socket.io@0.9
    npm install express@3.9

######Run the Example

1. Run app.js. `node app.js`
    
2. Navigate in your browser to `http://localhost:3000 (Client Page)` and `http://localhost:3000/admin.html (Admin Page)`

    >   This will bring up 2 pages. The first page will be the client page and the other will be the administration page.

3. On the client page mouse over the 'Help' tab

4. Enter in a key, then click the Create Key button.

5. On the admin page type in the key you just created and hit enter.

    > Now you should be able to see exactly what is happening on the client screen. There are still plenty of bugs with this application but it is in a usable state for anyone to begin playing with.

######How To use

1. Make sure that your file structure follows `lib/js` & `lib/css`, then change the CDN and SocketCDN variables to your server environment.

2. Add the screenshare.js script `public/lib/js/screenshare.js` before the closing body tag `</body>` on your html file(s)

3. Run the app.js `node app.js`

4. Open your website (there should now be a help tab on the right of your page)

5. Enter in a key, then click the Create Key button.

6. Open up another browser page to `http://localhost:3000/admin.html`

7. On the admin page type the key you created on your site and hit enter

    > Now you should be able to see exactly what is happening on the client screen. There are still plenty of bugs with this application but it is in a usable state for anyone to begin playing with.
